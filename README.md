Mapbox map displaying religious data of China. Loads pretty slowly, but it is making use of 80,000+ points of data. I wanted to test the limits of mapbox. May make use of "clustering" mapbox feature in the future: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/working-with-large-geojson-data/#clustering

Data file (religion2004.geojson) can only be found on aws site.
